<hr />
<div class="vbarea"><h2>Installing a new vBulletin 4 Community</h2>
<p>First, unzip the vBulletin zip file you downloaded from the members'
area to your hard disk and then open the <span
class="directory">'upload/includes/'</span> folder.
In this you will find <b>config.php.new</b>. You should rename this to
<b>config.php</b> and
then open it in a text editor.</p>
<p>The config.php file is commented throughout, so you should be able to
work
  out what values to enter for the variables yourself.<br />
  The values for the config.php file are described in detail here. </p>
<p>When you have finished, save the file and then upload the entire contents
of the <span class="directory">'upload/'</span> folder to
  your web server.</p>
<p>When this is done, point your browser at http://<font
color="red">www.example.com/forums/</font><b>install/install.php</b> (where
<font
color="red">www.example.com/forums/</font> is the URL of your vBulletin)</p>
<p>The install will ask for your <b>Customer Number</b> to login.</p>
<p>Once you are logged in you can proceed to follow the instructions on the
screen. When ready click the <span class="click">Next Step</span> buttons
until the script asks to fill in some addresses and names
for your board.</p>
<p>After you have done this, the installer will ask you for some details to
set you up as the administrator of the new vBulletin. A few more clicks and
the script will be finished.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the Admin Control Panel, you must delete the <span
class="directory">'install/install.php'</span>  and
  <span class="directory">'install/upgrade1.php'</span> files from your
webserver. You may then enter the control
  panel and start working on your new vBulletin!</p>
<p>The entire installation process should take no more than five
minutes.</p>
<p>For a complete description of how to install vBulletin 4, see the installation section
of the vBulletin
Manual.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="vbarea"><h2>Upgrades</h2>
<p>Before starting any upgrade to a new version of vBulletin the first step that
should be done is to take a backup.</p>
<p>You can find more information about backing up here: Database Backup</p>

<p>After backing up it may be a good idea to also disable your plugins, especially
between major versions of vBulletin. You can do this a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable from the config.php file: define("DISABLE_HOOKS", 1);</li>
<li>Disable from the AdminCP: AdminCP > Settings > Options > Plugin & Product System > </li>
<li>Disable one by one via the Product Manager</li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="vbarea"><h2>Upgrading from vBulletin 4.0.x</h2>
<p>Close your board via the Admin Control Panel.</p>

<p>Upload all files from the 'upload/' folder in the zip, with the exception of
'install/install.php'. Then open the 'upload/includes/' folder. In this you
will find config.php.new. You should rename this to config.php and then open
it in a text editor.</p>

<p>Open your browser and point the URL to
http://www.example.com/forum/install/upgrade.php (where
www.example.com/forums/ is the URL of your vBulletin). You should now be
automatically forwarded to the appropriate upgrade script and step.</p>

<p><b><span style="color:red;">If any errors occur, copy the error and please contact support. DO NOT continue 
with the upgrade. Doing so may cause irreversible damage to the database.</span></b></p>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure you click next step or
proceed until you are redirected to your Admin Control Panel. Here, you can
reopen your board.</p>

</div>
<hr />
<div class="vbarea"><h2>Upgrading from vBulletin 3.8.4 </h2>
<p>Close your board via the Admin Control Panel.</p>
<p>Upload all files from the <span class="directory">'upload/'</span> folder
  in the zip, with the exception of <span
class="directory">'install/install.php'</span>.
  Then open the <span class="directory">'upload/includes/'</span>
folder.</p>
<p>Open your browser and point the URL to http://<font
color="red">www.example.com/forum/</font><b>install/upgrade.php</b> (where
<font
color="red">www.example.com/forums/</font> is the URL of your vBulletin).
You should now be automatically forwarded to the appropriate upgrade script
and step.</p>

<p><b><span style="color:red;">If any errors occur, copy the error and please contact support. DO NOT continue 
with the upgrade. Doing so may cause irreversible damage to the database.</span></b></p>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure you click <span
class="click">next
    step</span> or <span class="click">proceed</span> until
  you are redirected to your Admin Control Panel. Here, you can reopen your
    board.</p>
<p>For a complete description of how to upgrade from a previous version of
vBulletin to the latest version, see the upgrade section of the
vBulletin Manual.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="vbarea"><h2>Upgrading from older versions of vBulletin</h2>
<p>Before upgrading to vBulletin 4.0, you will need to download the files to
upgrade to vBulletin 3.8.4. Once your community is running on vBulletin
3.8.4, then you can upload the vBulletin 4.0 files and perform the upgrade
to this version. If you need assistance with this, contact vBulletin
Support.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> vBulletin 4.0 uses a new Template and Stylevar engine. This
means your previous styles are not compatible with vBulletin 4.0. When you
upgrade, they will be disabled and a new style will be created and set as
the default style.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> There are several upgrade scripts that need to be run. You
do not need to determine which you need to run; they will be determined
automatically. Simply click "next step" or "proceed" until you are
redirected to your admin control panel.</p>

<p>When the scripts are complete, it will tell you to delete some files, and
then redirect you to the Admin Control Panel. You should log in to this and
proceed to the <i>Maintenance</i> section of the
control panel, where you should run the Update Counters tools. The
<i>Rebuild Search Index</i> and <i>Rebuild Statistics</i> will take a quite
a long time to run on larger boards.</p>
