<b>Access Masks:</b><br />
Access Masks allow you grant permission to view a forum, or alternatively to deny permission to view a forum, on a per-user basis without making an additional usergroup. This works in conjunction with the Forum Permission system.<br /><br />

Note that inheritance applies here; if you allow a user to view a parent forum, they will also have access to any children forums.<br /><br />

You must enable access masks in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=general&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>, otherwise changes made here will do nothing.]]></text>

<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Calendars</a><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=calendarpermission&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Calendar Permissions</a><br /><br />

<b>Calendars:</b><br />
vBulletin's calendar system is very advanced. In addition to allowing both public and private events, it allows you to have multiple calendars with usergroup permissions for each.<br /><br />

Calendar administration is relatively easy. vBulletin ships with a default calendar, with most options turned on. You can reach this calendar by clicking Calendar Manager under Calendars &amp; Moderators in the left navigation bar. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=modify">Modifying Calendars</a>)<br /><br />

You can also assign moderators to each calendar. Follow the steps above to reach the calendar modification screen, then select 'Add' on the Moderator drop-down across from the appropriate calendar to start the process. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=addmod">Adding a Calendar Moderator</a>)<br /><br />

Also on the Modify screen you can edit any existing moderators - simply select their name from the moderator drop-down and press Go. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=editmod">Editing a Calendar Moderator</a>)<br /><br />

From the Modify screen, you can select to edit any calendar by choosing Edit from the Controls drop-down menu across from that calendar. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=edit">Editing a Calendar</a>)<br /><br />

After you have modified the default calendar, you may wish to add more. Click Add New Calendar under Calendars &amp; Moderators in the left nav bar to add another calendar. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=add">Adding a Calendar</a>)<br /><br />

After adding a calendar, you can add custom fields to facilitate easy entry of information that is particular to a given calendar. From the Modify screen, select Edit from the Controls drop-down across from the calendar you wish to add fields to, then select Add Field next to Custom Fields. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=addcustom">Adding/Editing Custom Calendar Fields</a>)<br /><br />

Permissions are usually the last thing to be given to a calendar, since it obviously must exist before they can be added. Each usergroup has default calendar permissions that are assigned to it when a new calendar is created. You can change these by clicking Calendar Permissions under Calendars and Moderators in the left nav bar. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=calendarpermission&amp;pageaction=modify">Modifying Usergroup Calendar Permissions</a>)<br /><br />

The Holiday Manager allows you to add or remove holidays from the calendar system. Each calendar can be set separately to show or hide holidays; the Holiday Manager is where you determine what holidays show when holidays are turned on for a  calendar. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=admincalendar&amp;pageaction=modifyholiday">Modifying Holidays</a>)]]></text>

			<text date="1153498962" username="Jelsoft" version="3.6.0 Release Candidate 3"><![CDATA[The User Infraction system is designed to automate the management of misbehaving users.
<br /><br />
The first step in the system is the creation of Infraction Levels.  These levels will vary based on the content of the forum and the scale of the system that you wish to create.  You can create just a few levels or can get very detailed with many levels covering a myriad of forum infractions.
<br /><br />
When creating levels, keep in mind a point total at which you wish to start penalizing users by taking away permissions.  If you envision taking away a certain permission when a user accumulates 10 infraction points then you need to consider how many points will be given for each infraction and how quickly the user can get to 10 points.
<br /><br />
Each infraction level has an expiration time. When the infraction expires, the associated points are removed from the user's point total and the user's infraction groups are recalculated.
<br /><br />
Infraction levels can also be allowed to be given as warnings. A warning does not add any infraction points to the user's point total.  Warnings serve as a method to remind user's of your forum's rules and encourage them to be followed without awarding infraction points. Moderators have the ability to give an infraction or a warning for those levels that have the warning ability enabled.
<br /><br />
The second step in the system is to create Infraction Groups that penalize users in the manner that you wish.
<br /><br />
Normal permissions work by combining all of a user's usergroup permissions and granting a permission for any that have a yes. Infraction group permissions work in the reverse as all infraction group permissions are combined and any permission with a No is taken from the user.  You should set up your infraction usergroups (in the Usergroup Manager) by setting all permissions to Yes and then setting those that you wish to take away to No.
<br /><br />
A user can have multiple infraction groups as they will gain all groups that apply to their primary usergroupid that have a point total less than or equal to their accumulated points.]]></text>

Access control to the admin log is <b>not</b> controlled through the control panel for security reasons.<br />
Access to the admin log is controlled with two variables which are located in includes/config.php file.<br /><br />

Both variables can take either a single number, or a list of numbers separated by commas, each representing userids which have access to the admin log.<br /><br />

If you would like to change the current access permissions to the adminlog, you may do so by opening <i>includes/config.php</i> in a text editor and modifying the following variables<br /><br />

<pre> $config['SpecialUsers']['canviewadminlog'] = '1,10';
 $config['SpecialUsers']['canpruneadminlog'] = '1';</pre>

This will restrict viewing access to this script to only you (usually userid 1) and the member with userid 10. Access to prune entries from the log would be restricted to you (usually userid 1).<br /><br />

If the $config['SpecialUsers']['canviewadminlog'] line is omitted from config.php, or if the value is blank (<i>$config['SpecialUsers']['canviewadminlog'] = '';</i>), all administrators will have access to view the admin log.<br />
Conversely, if the $config['SpecialUsers']['canpruneadminlog'] line is omitted or blank, <i>nobody</i> will be granted pruning permission.<br />]]></text>

			<text date="1205430879" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0 Release Candidate 1"><![CDATA[<b>User Reputations:</b><br />
vBulletin's user reputation system provides a way of rating users based on the quality of their posts.  Users on your forums can add or subtract reputation points from other users by clicking the reputation link in their posts.  You can set restrictions on the giving and taking away of reputation points by users in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=reputation&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.<br /><br />

User reputations allow the users in your community to tell vBulletin which users are quality and which users are not.  And in response to user feedback, vBulletin has the ability to label and reward users for the quality of their posts, as is indicated by their reputation.<br /><br />

You can label quality users by defining reputation levels in the <a href="adminreputation.php?do=modify" target="_blank">User Reputation Manager</a>.  User reputation levels work very similar to user titles and user ranks in that they are an indicator of status that are displayed next to names in posts.<br /><br />

You can reward quality users by creating promotions on the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modifypromotion" target="_blank">Promotions</a> page.  Promotions are used to change a user's group memberships when they meet certain conditions, one of which can be their reputation level.  Because forum permissions can be controlled with group memberships, a user's reputation in conjunction with promotions can be used to control a user's forum permissions.  And so by using a combination of user reputations, promotions, and group permissions, you can enable your community to reward and punish good and bad posters on your forums.]]></text>

Please note that if you do not have enough disk space in the intended destination, the process will fail, but your pictures will be safe as tests are done first to ensure there is enough space.<br />
<br />
Pictures will not be removed from the database or filesystem and your storage type setting will not be changed until the end of the process.
If the process aborts before the end, you will need to free up space or prune pictures before trying again.<br />
<br />
If you are moving pictures from the file system into the database, you must have enough storage space on the drive and/or partition where your database is located.<br />
<br />
There are two file system methods that you may choose from:
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct browser access to the thumbnails</strong> - this method makes the album pages faster as each thumbnail does not need a database hit. However, if users know the URL to a thumbnail, they will be able to bypass any permissions or contact-only settings and view the thumbnail. Full size pictures will always be accessed via a vBulletin script and thus subject to permission checks.</li>
<li><strong>No direct browser access to the thumbnails</strong> - this method still takes the binary data out of the database, but each thumbnail is accessed via a vBulletin script, which causes a database connection. However, permissions are respected for thumbnails as well as full size pictures.</li>
</ul>
When pictures in the database, permissions are always respected.<br />
<br />
If you are moving pictures into the file system, you will need to make the folder (or folders) writeable by PHP. The easiest way to do this is CHMOD it 777 (consult your FTP, Telnet, or SSH documentation for more info on how to do this). More information on where to put these folder(s) is available on the following pages.]]></text>

			<text date="0" username="Jelsoft" version=""><![CDATA[<b>Announcements:</b><br />
vBulletin's announcement system allows you to communicate important information to your users. While there are other methods for doing this (such as Sticky threads), announcements have several distinct advantages: you can use HTML without enabling it in a forum (which is <b>very dangerous</b>), you can set the announcement to not appear until sometime in the future and automatically disappear on a certain date, and you can add an announcement to show up in all forums.<br /><br />

If you have multiple announcements in a forum, global announcements included, they will all be displayed in one thread, which can be accessed by clicking on the title of the most recent announcement on forumdisplay.<br /><br />

Announcements are never automatically removed. When the End Date set for an announcement is reached, it will disappear from end-user view. It can be removed or reactivated from the Admin CP at any time. To reactivate an expired announcement, simply change the End Date to some date in the future.<br /><br />

To add an announcement, click Add New Announcement under Announcements in the left navigation bar, or click New across from the forum it should apply to. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=announcement&amp;pageaction=add">Adding Announcements</a>)<br /><br />

Once you have one or more announcements, you can view a list of them and the forums they belong to. Click Announcement Manager under Announcements in the left navigation bar to see a list of your forums and announcements. From here you can create a new global or forum-specific announcement, or modify or remove an existing one. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=announcement&amp;pageaction=modify">Modifying Announcements</a>)<br /><br />

From here, click Edit to modify the properties or text of an announcement, or Delete to remove it. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=announcement&amp;pageaction=edit">Editing Announcements</a>)]]></text>

<b>Attachments:</b><br />
vBulletin supports file uploads to posts, called post attachments.  Post attachments are useful in attaching any kind of file that relates to a post including images, text files, pdfs, zips, and any other file type you allow to be attached to posts.<br /><br />

vBulletin provides you with two options for storing post attachments: 1) you can store them in the database or 2) you can store them in the file system on your web server.  Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.  The database is more efficient with storage space and is easier to backup than individual files.  However, storing attachments in the database is also an extra burden on the database when users download attachments.  Other considerations include how you want to restrict access to attachments, whether you want to use vBulletin's permission system or directory permissions like htaccess.<br /><br />

vBulletin's attachment system allows you to specify maximum file sizes for each type of file you allow to be attached.  Some file types tend to belong to larger files (videos and images versus text for example) and this ability allows you to take that into consideration.<br /><br />

On the topic of maximum file sizes, vBulletin allows you to limit the total size of all of a user's attachments at the group level (see the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>).  This is useful in preventing any one user from taking up too much storage with their attachments.<br /><br />

Another nice feature of vBulletin's attachment system is its support for thumbnails.  When a user posts an image attachment you can configure vBulletin to generate a miniature version of the image (called a thumbnail) that is linked to the larger version of the image.  This is useful in preventing large inline image attachments from stretching your forum layout.  You can configure thumbnails and many other attachment options in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=attachment&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.  If you are using the ImageMagick library, then you may be able to create thumbnails from additional image types: BMP, TIF, PSD, and PDF.  You should have the latest versions of ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed for creating thumbnails from PDF files. Thumbnailing large PDF files may still cause problems so use this option with caution.<br /><br />

Like other forum permissions in vBulletin, the ability of a user to post attachments can be set at the group level (see the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>), and at the group level for a specific forum (see <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a>).]]></text>

Attachments will not be removed from the database or filesystem and your storage type setting will not be changed until the end of the process.<br />
If the process aborts before the end, you will need to free up space or prune attachments before trying again.<br /><br />

If you are moving attachments into the file system, it is recommended that you do *not* place the folder under your web root (usually named public_html or www or www_root) because people will be able to bypass vBulletin's permission system and download them. Also, you will need to make the folder writeable by PHP. The easiest way to do this is CHMOD it 777 (consult your FTP, Telnet, or SSH documentation for more info on how to do this). We do not recommended that you put a folder that is CHMODed 777 under your web root - another good reason to have it located above the document root.<br /><br />

<b>User Picture Storage:</b><br />
vBulletin supports two storage types for avatars and profile pictures : database or file system.<br /><br />

Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.  The database is easier to backup than individual files.  However, storing user pictures in the database is also an extra burden on the database when images are loaded on forum pages.  Other considerations include how you want to protect access to the images, whether you want to use vBulletin's permission system or directory permissions like htaccess.]]></text>

<b>User Banning:</b><br />
The banning pages in the Users tab of the Admin CP allow you to ban users and view users which are currently banned.<br /><br />

You can ban users at the <i>Ban User</i> page of the Moderator Control Panel.  You are given a choice of ban length and banned usergroup to which you want to move the user.  If you want a usergroup to be used for banning then you need to enable the "This Usergroup is a 'Banned' Group" option for that group in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>; all usergroups with this option enabled will show up as selectable banned usergroups on the Ban User page.<br /><br />

Additionally, you can view a list of currently banned users on the View Banned Users page of the Moderator Control Panel.  This page shows you all current temporary and permanent bans and gives you the option to lift any bans you choose.]]></text>

BB code is a special coding system, similar to HTML, where you type in tags around your text and the text is formatted. For example, typing:<br /><br />

[b]My Text[/b]<br /><br />

...would produce:<br /><br />

<b>My Text</b><br /><br />

It is a safe and easy way to allow your users to format their posts. It does not have the security risks of allowing HTML, and users cannot mess up page layouts by accidentally leaving a tag open. You as the admin control what tags are available to your users.]]></text>

			<text date="1206965793" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0 Release Candidate 2"><![CDATA[This is the HTML code that replaces the user-entered BB code. Make sure that you include '{param}' (without the quotes) to insert the text between the opening and closing BB code tags, and '{option}' for the parameter within the BB code tag. You can only use {option} if 'Use Option' is set to yes below.<br />
eg. [b]My Text[/b] turns into <b>My Text</b>. To create that tag, enter<br />
&lt;b&gt;{param}&lt;/b&gt;<br />
If you were to create a tag like the URL tag, you would use {option}. The URL tag can be used like this:<br />
[url]http://www.example.com[/url]<br />
which turns into<br />
<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a><br />
It can alternatively be used like this:<br />
[url=http://www.example.com/]My Site[/url]<br />
which would turn into this:<br />
<a href="http://www.example.com/">My Site</a><br />
This is actually two different tags with the same code to make it easy on the end-user.<br />
To create the first tag, you would enter<br />
&lt;a href="{param}"&gt;{param}&lt;/a&gt;<br />
To create the second, you would enter<br />
&lt;a href="{option}"&gt;{param}&lt;/a&gt;<br />
If you are using options, option is what is entered <b>within</b> the tag, e.g. www.example.com in the following:<br />
[url=www.example.com]<br />
{param} is what is entered <b>between</b> tags, e.g. My Site in the following:<br />
[url=www.example.com]My Site[/url]<br />
You will always use '{param}', but you will only use '{option}' when "Use Option?" is "yes" and you need a second bit of input from the user as in the above example.]]></text>

			<title date="0" username="Jelsoft" version="">About Common Templates, StyleVars, and CSS</title>
			<text date="1205431035" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0 Release Candidate 1"><![CDATA[<b>Related General Help Topics:</b><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=template&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Styles &amp; Templates</a><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=css&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Common Templates, StyleVars, and CSS</a><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=replacement&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Replacement Variables</a><br /><br />

<b>Common Templates:</b><br />
The header, headinclude, and footer templates are considered common templates because they are included / parsed on every forum page.<br /><br />

The header, headinclude, and footer templates are respectively represented in the templates by the $header, $headinclude, and $footer variables.  The parsed contents of these three templates are substituted in for these variables when a forum page is loaded.<br /><br />

The header template contains the HTML code that makes up the top portion of your forum layout, including the title image and opening table code for the content table in which your forum content is displayed.<br /><br />

The contents of the headinclude template are inserted within the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags on each forum page. Meta tags, style sheets, scripts, etc are added here.<br /><br />

The footer template contains the HTML code that makes up the bottom portion of your forum layout, including the closing table tags for the content table in which your forum content is displayed and the vBulletin copyright notice.<br /><br />

<b>StyleVars:</b><br />
The StyleVars on this page include the "Size and Dimensions", "Image Paths", and "Miscellaneous" tables below.  These settings control various style related aspects of your forum pages.  These stylevars are represented in the templates as:<br /><br />

<i>$stylevar[var_name]</i><br /><br />

These stylevar variables are parsed into their corresponding values when a forum page is loaded.  By representing commonly used stylevars as variables in the templates it is very easy to change them - just edit their values on this page and the changes will take effect for all forum pages.<br /><br />

<b>CSS:</b><br />
vBulletin uses CSS classes for its various page elements.  These page elements all call on the various CSS classes defined here.  Therefore, you can change the attributes of all page elements that use a CSS class by editing the class on this page.  A good site to learn CSS is <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">w3.org</a>.<br /><br />

Note that several CSS attributes are color fields which use standard HTML color codes.  You can click on the color box to the right to pull up the color picker window where you can visually pick a color by clicking on it.  vBulletin will automatically insert the corresponding color code for the color you pick.  The small button to the left of the close box allows you to switch color palettes for more choices.  The dotted box on the top left represents no color (transparent).]]></text>

			<text date="1258131495" username="Jelsoft" version="4.0.0 Beta 4"><![CDATA[<p>vBulletin offers two different Google AdSense packages. Each package will implement a different set of advertising units into the forum advertising templates. You may also control the type of ad that is delivered in each unit.</p>

<p><b>Type of Ads to Show</b></p>

<p>With this option, you may control the type of ads delivered by Google AdSense.</p>

<ul><li>Text ads only: AdSense will only show ads consisting of text and links.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Text and image ads: AdSense will only show advertistments that contain images if possible but fall back to text-only ads if necessary. This is the recommended option.</li></ul>

<p><b>No Google AdSense Ads</b></p>

<p>This option will remove all Google AdSense code from the vBulletin forum advertising templates.</p>

<p><b>Low Package Ad Units</b></p>

<p>The Low package adds two small advertising units to the main forum pages:</p>

<ul><li>Below the header navigation bar: Horizontal link unit with 5 contextual links to related advertising. This unit is always text. Ad unit color same as background.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Below the page content, above the footer: Small, horizontal advertising block. Ad unit color same as background.</li></ul>

<p><b>High Package Ad Units</b></p>

<ul><li>Below the header navigation bar: Medium, horizontal advertisting block. Ad unit color contrasts with background.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Below the page content, above the footer:  Medium, horizontal text advertising block. Ad unit color same as background.</li></ul>

<ul><li>First post, right hand side of content: Only visible for guests (or registered members who haven't logged in).  Nearly-square advertising block.</li></ul>

<p><b>Further Information from Google</b></p>

<b>Diagnostics:</b><br />
The diagnostics page contains several diagnostics that are useful for troubleshooting problems with your forums.<br /><br />

The "Upload" diagnostic tests file uploading functionality on your server.  If your server isn't configured correctly for file uploads then several vBulletin features will not work including custom avatar uploads and post attachments.<br /><br />

The "Email" diagnostic will send a test email to the address you specify.  If you receive the test email then PHP and your mail server are configured correctly.  Otherwise they are not configured correctly and you need to contact your host.  Without email functionality you will not be able to use any email features on your forums including email verification on registration and "send to friend."<br /><br />

The "Suspect File Versions" diagnostic checks the version of every PHP file in your forum directory and tells you which ones are for different versions of vBulletin than the one you are running.  Running files that are not meant for your version of vBulletin can cause any number of problems.  If any files are for different versions then you should upload the originals from the vBulletin zip file for the version you are running.<br /><br />

The "System Information" diagnostics report on your MySQL configuration and the status of your database.  vBulletin team members may ask you to give them the output of these reports to help them troubleshoot problems with your server and forums.]]></text>

<b>Emailing Users:</b><br />
The email pages in the Users tab of the Admin CP allow you to send mass emails and generate mailing lists based on the same search criteria you use to search for users on the <a href="user.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Search for Users</a> page.<br /><br />

You can email users on the <a href="email.php?do=start" target="_blank">Send Email to Users</a> page and you can generate a mailing list of email addresses on the <a href="email.php?do=genlist" target="_blank">Generate Mailing List</a> page.  Both pages use the same search criteria.  vBulletin emails / includes in the mailing list only users whose profiles match the search criteria you specify.  One obvious application of these email features is to send out mass emails notifying your members of updates to your forums.  Other applications include sending warning emails to inactive users before you prune their accounts or otherwise deal with them.]]></text>

The vBulletin FAQ system allows you to create infinitely nestable sets of entries, or questions, and additionally allows end-users to search the FAQs.  FAQs are typically a collection of Frequently Asked Questions, while vBulletin's FAQ system is something of a FAQ / Knowledge Base hybrid because of its searchability.<br /><br />

vBulletin ships with a number of default sets and entries that are focused on using vBulletin from the end-user's perspective.  You may wish to add additional FAQs that answer questions about your specific forum configuration - forum permissions for example.<br /><br />

The FAQ system also supports multiple languages.  Each FAQ entry can have a translation for each language in the <a href="language.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Language Manager</a>.  When a user loads a FAQ page vBulletin will display its FAQ entries in the language in which the current logged in user is viewing your forums.]]></text>

Under the Forum Controls, across from each forum title, are the following options:<br />
<b>Edit</b>: Lets you modify forum settings. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=forum.php&amp;pageaction=edit">Editing Forums</a>)<br /><br />

<b>Remove</b>: Deletes the forum, any subforums, and posts in the forum and any subforums. This action <b>cannot</b> be undone, so it is <i>highly</i> recommended that you make a backup of your database before doing this.<br /><br />

<b>Add Sub-forum</b>: This allows you to add a forum that will be a child of the forum you select this for. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=forum.php&amp;pageaction=add">Adding Forums</a>)<br /><br />

<b>Add Announcement</b>: Allows you to add an announcement to this forum. (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=announcement.php&amp;pageaction=add">Adding Announcements</a>)<br /><br />

<b>Move Contents</b>: You can quickly move all the posts from the selected forum into another forum.<br /><br />

<b>Empty Forum</b>: Selecting this will (after confirmation) remove all the threads in a forum.<br /><br />

In the next column is Display Order. This determines what order forums are displayed in anyplace they are shown, including in the Admin CP. Setting this to 0 for a forum will make the forum not show anywhere to the end-user, but it can still be accessed if the user types in the direct URL to the forum. Be sure to select Update Display Order if you have changed any of them.<br /><br />

The last dropdown shows how many moderators you already have in each forum. If you have any, they will be listed. You can modify a moderator's permissions by selecting their name from this drop-down and pressing Go.]]></text>

By default, users will have the permissions for their usergroup (see the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>) in each forum.  However, you might not want users of a particular usergroup to have access to every forum.  In that case, vBulletin allows you to create custom permissions for a specific forum for a specific usergroup.  This is useful in restricting certain forums for certain usergroups.]]></text>

Select which forum(s) permissions should be copied from in the drop-down. This will include any subforums of the forum you choose.

Overwrite Inherited set to Yes will overwrite permissions in forums that are being inherited from parents. Click Duplicate Permissions to proceed.]]></text>

The color of each usergroup is significant. If the usergroup text is in white, it is using the default permissions for the group. If the usergroup text is in red, it is using permissions customized for that forum. If it is in yellow, it is using custom permissions from a parent forum. If you are using Internet Explorer 4+ or Netscape 6+, the circle next to each usergroup name is also significant. A hollow circle means the usergroup cannot view the forum, while a full circle means they can.<br /><br />

To edit the permissions for any group, or to revert them to default, click Edit next to the appropriate group under the appropriate forum.<br /><br />

The Permission Duplicator, accessible from the link at the top of this screen, allows you to quickly duplicate an existing permission set between usergroups or between forums. (see <a href="help.php?page=forumpermission&amp;pageaction=duplicate">Using the Permission Duplicator</a>)<br /><br />

You can also access the Quick Editor from here. The Quick Editor allows you to quickly revert permissions to default. (see <a href="help.php?page=forumpermission&amp;pageaction=quickedit">Using the Quick Editor</a>)<br /><br />

The last link at the top is Quick Forum Setup. You can use this to mass-apply permissions to multiple usergroups for a particular forum. (see <a href="help.php?page=forumpermission&amp;pageaction=quickforum">Using Quick Forum Setup</a>)]]></text>

Usergroup restrictions are set at the category level while post count restrictions are set at the image level.  To have access to an image category the user must be a member of at least one group (either primary or secondary group membership) that has access, as is explained in the general help topic for <a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=usergroup&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Usergroups</a>.<br /><br />]]></text>

<b>Languages:</b><br />
vBulletin's language system allows you to translate your forum into other languages without editing any templates or files.  This is thanks to the phrase system (see "Phrases" link above) which makes vBulletin's templates language-independent.  The end result is that you can serve multiple languages from a single style.<br /><br />

Each phrase can have a translation for each language specified in this Language Manager.  When a forum page is loaded, vBulletin checks what language the current logged in user has selected and parses the phrase variables into the appropriate translated text.<br /><br />

In addition to translated phrases, vBulletin's language system supports translated images (by allowing you to override a style's images folder setting), and language-specific date / time / number formats.]]></text>

<b>Update Counters:</b><br />
This page allows you to update several vBulletin counters.  Not all information that is displayed on vBulletin forum pages is dynamically generated.  "Counters" are used instead of some costly queries in order to reduce the server load associated with retrieving information.<br /><br />

User post counts are a good example of a counter.  vBulletin doesn't count the number of posts a user has every time their post count is displayed on the forums.  Instead the user has a post counter that is incremented every time they make a post.  This way when vBulletin wants to display a user's post count it only has to read a number instead of all of the records in the post table.]]></text>

			<text date="1206964458" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0 Release Candidate 2"><![CDATA[This page contains several counters that you can update.<br /><br />

<b>Update Forums:</b><br />
This feature will update the information for each forum including: last post info, thread count, and post count.  This may need to be done after mass moving / pruning threads and posts.<br /><br />

<b>Update User Titles and Ranks:</b><br />
This will go through every user on your forums and determine their correct user title and rank.  This may need to be done after changing your <a href="usertitle.php?do=modify" target="_blank">user title ladder</a> or <a href="ranks.php" target="_blank">user ranks</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Update User Names:</b><br />
This will update user names everywhere they occur on your forums.  This may need to be done after changing a user's name in the Admin CP.<br /><br />

<b>Update Post Counts:</b><br />
This will update the number of posts for each user by counting each user's posts in the database.  If you have artificially inflated / deflated a user's post count by editing their profile in the Admin CP then this will reset it to its true value.<br /><br />

<b>Fix broken user profiles:</b><br />
Incomplete profiles are usually the result of hacks making user insertions from outside of vBulletin.  Run this to fix any broken profiles.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Forum Information:</b><br />
This feature will update your forum counters and check for orphan moderators.  This may need to be run after managing your forums.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Thread Information:</b><br />
This feature will update your thread counters including: last post info, reply count, view count, etc.  You may need to run this after moving / pruning threads and posts.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Similar Threads:</b><br />
This feature will run a similar thread search for all threads on your forums.  To show similar threads you need to enable the option in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=showthread&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.  If you want your forums to search for similar threads when a new thread is posted (rather than having to update this counter later) then you need to enable the option on <a href="options.php?dogroup=search&amp;do=options" target="_blank">this page</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Search Index:</b><br />
This needs to be done after changing the max / min search word length in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=search&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Statistics:</b><br />
This feature rebuilds the information that is displayed on your <a href="stats.php?do=index" target="_blank">Statistics page</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Post Cache:</b><br />
vBulletin doesn't parse BB code in posts every time they are displayed.  Instead the parsed posts are saved in the "postparsed" table.  In this way vBulletin reduces the processing time needed to display a post.  Update this counter to rebuild the parsed posts.  This needs to be done after changing BB code tags, posting allowances (like HTML code), etc.<br /><br />

<b>Delete Duplicate Threads:</b><br />
Sometimes duplicate threads are created during the posting process.  Updating this counter will remove those duplicates.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Styles:</b><br />
Update this counter to rebuild your style structure.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Attachment Thumbnails:</b><br />
Rebuilding thumbnails is necessary after changing your thumbnail settings in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=attachment&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild User Reputation:</b><br />
You need to update this counter if you change the default reputation value in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=reputation&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.<br /><br />

<b>Remove Orphan Threads:</b><br />
This function will delete any threads that belong to forums that no longer exist. Such threads are not accessible via the forums but they do add to your totals. You will see the number of orphan threads in parenthesis.<br /><br />

<b>Remove Orphan Posts:</b><br />
This function will delete any posts that belong to threads that no longer exist. Such posts are not accessible via the forums but they do add your your totals. You will see the number of orphan posts in parenthesis.]]></text>

			<text date="1209205296" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0"><![CDATA[Here, there are listed a number of conditions you can set in order for your notice to be displayed.<br />
<br />
To activate a criterion, check the checkbox next to its description, then enter the values you would like to use in the form fields for that criterion, if it has any.<br />
<br />
All active criteria must be satisfied in order for a notice to be displayed.<br />
<br />
For criteria that are of the form 'value is between x and y', the condition is inclusive. Therefore, if you have a criterion saying 'User has between 10 and 20 reputation points', a user with 10 or 20 reputation points or any value between would be shown the notice.<br />
<br />
Additionally, these 'value is between x and y' criteria can be used as 'less than' or 'greater than' conditions. To do this, leave the <em>first</em> box totally empty to set a condition of 'less than the value in the second box', or leave the <em>second</em> box blank to use a condition of 'greater than the value in the first box'.<br />
<br />
The 'Criteria for notice x are not met' condition is a special case. It works by looking back over the list of notices that have been selected for display, and then removing notices that are dependent on another notice not being matched for display.<br />
<br />
Consider the following example:<ul>
<li>Notices A, B and C exist.</li>
<li>Notice A is shown when visiting users belong to the 'Registered Users' group</li>
<li>Notice B is shown if criteria for notice A are not met</li>
<li>Notice C is shown if criteria for notice B are not met</li>
<li>A registered user views a page. Notice A is shown</li>
<li>Notice B is not shown, because the criteria for showing Notice A are met</li>
<li>Notice C is not shown, because (with the exception of the 'Criteria for notice x are not met' condition), Notice B would have been shown.</li>
<li>The final result is that only Notice A is shown. The same is true regardless of the order in which the notices are executed or displayed.</li>

<br />
At the top of the list is a checkbox that allows you to toggle the 'Active' status of all notices with one click.<br />
<br />
To edit a notice, click its title. To delete a notice, there is a 'Delete' link at the end of each notice's row in the manager.<br />
<br />
Each notice is displayed with two checkboxes and a text box containing a number. These represent the Active status, the Persistent nature of the notice, and the notice's Display Order.<br />
<br />
If a notice is not active, it will not be displayed to visitors under any circumstances.<br />
<br />
A notice that is not persistent will be displayed the first time a user visits the board and will then disappear until they visit again (it is displayed once per browser-session).<br />
<br />
The display order text box controls the order in which the notice is shown, both in the notices manager <em>and</em> to visitors. Display order also controls the order in which notices are checked, so it's important for the 'Notice x has not already been displayed' condition.<br />
<br />
After using the Active, Persistent and Display Order controls, you need to click the 'Save' button to commit your changes.]]></text>

			<text date="1211458472" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.1"><![CDATA[You may specify additional separators for tags. The comma is the default separator and cannot be removed, regardless of what is set here.<br />
<br />
Simply place a space between each separator. For example, "| &amp;" would mean that tags would be separated by a comma (,), pipe (|), or ampersand (&amp;). Separators may be multiple characters, if desired.<br />
<br />
If you wish to include a space as a separator or within a separator, you must wrap the separator in { and }. For example, to make space a separator, you would use "{ }". To put a space within a separator, you would use something like "{| |}"; this would mean that to separate tags you would have to use "| |".<br />
<br />
Note that adding separators may make previous tags unusable. For example, if you had a tag "American cars" and added space as a separator, users that try to add that tag will add two tags, "American" and "cars".<br />
<br />
When adding separators to this list, you may wish to modify the contents of two phrases to respect the additional separators:
<ul>
<li>separate_tags_using_comma</li>
<li>tag_no_comma</li>
</ul>]]></text>

This may be specified to change the base URL for all CMS links.  This is useful if you run the CMS from a location that differs from your Forum URL.<br /><br />

You may specify an absolute URL such as <b>http://www.example.com/</b>, or a URL relative to your Forum URL.  If your forum is in /forum and your CMS is at the root of your webserver then you may use <b>../</b>.  If you use an absolute URL the option <i>Always use Forum URL as Base Path</i> will have no effect for CMS pages, and the CMS url specified will always be used.

If you wish to run your CMS from a location other than your Forum URL then you must ensure that the appropriate entry scripts have been set up.  These include:<br />

<ul>
<li>content.php or index.php</li>
<li>editor.php</li>
<li>list.php</li>
<li>widget.php</li>
</ul>

The easiest way to do this is to create text files with the following:<br /><br />

<b>&lt;?#shebang#?&gt;&lt;?php<br />
define(VB_RELATIVE_PATH, 'your_forum_path');<br />
chdir('./' . VB_RELATIVE_PATH);<br />
require('script.php');</b><br /><br />

<b>&lt;?#shebang#?&gt;&lt;?php<br />

These indexes are not used by the fulltext search and consume a large portion of your database.  You should be certain that you are going to permanently use the fulltext search before removing these indexes since, generally, it takes a lot of time and server load to rebuild these indexes.  Another consideration is during any time that the fulltext option is enabled, these indexes will not be updated by any new posts.  Using fulltext search for an extended period of time will leave these indexes stale and you may still wish to rebuild them.<br />
<br />
You can also empty these indexes in the <i>Update Counters</i> section of <i>Maintenance</i>.<br />

vBulletin's phrase system is used to make the templates language-independent.  Everywhere there would normally be a hard coded, language-specific phrase there is a variable that parses to the value of the phrase for the language in which the user is viewing your forums.  Some phrases will be represented in the templates like this:<br /><br />

<i>$vbphrase[phrase_identifier]</i><br /><br />

While other phrases that have variables in them will be represented like this:<br /><br />

<i>&lt;phrase 1="value for variable 1" 2="value for variable 2"&gt;$vbphrase[phrase_identifier]&lt;/phrase&gt;</i><br /><br />

			<text date="1205431035" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0 Release Candidate 1"><![CDATA[<b>User Profile Fields:</b><br />
User profile fields have two main applications.  First, they can be used to hold information about your users.  For example, a default vBulletin profile field is the "Location" field where a user can enter their location.  Second, profile fields can be used as forum options to drive conditionals in your templates.  This application is explained in <a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=profilefield&amp;pageaction=edit&amp;option=form">this</a> help topic.<br /><br />

There are different types of profile fields that can be selected when creating a new profile field on the <a href="profilefield.php?do=add" target="_blank">Add New User Profile Field</a> page.  Below are examples of each kind of profile field:<br /><br />

<b>Single-line Text Box (input)</b>: In HTML, this is<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;input type="text" name="" /&gt;</span><br />
which equates to this:<br />
<input type="text" name="none" value="" /><br /><br />

<b>Multi-line Text Box (textarea)</b>: In HTML, this is<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;textarea name=""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</span><br />
which equates to this:<br />
<textarea name="none" rows="3" cols="20"></textarea><br /><br />

<b>Single-selection Radio Buttons (radio)</b>: In HTML, this is<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;input type="radio" name="a" /&gt; Option 1<br />
&lt;input type="radio" name="a" /&gt; Option 2</span><br />
which equates to this:<br />
<input type="radio" name="a" /> Option 1<br />
<input type="radio" name="a" /> Option 2<br /><br />

<b>Single-selection Menu (select)</b>: In HTML, this is<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;select name="sel"&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="1"&gt;Option 1&lt;option&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="2"&gt;Option 2&lt;option&gt;<br />
&lt;/select&gt;</span><br />
which equates to this:<br />
<select name="sel">
<option value="1">Option 1</option>
<option value="2">Option 2</option>
</select><br /><br />

<b>Multiple-selection Menu (select multiple)</b>: In HTML, this is<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;select name="sel" multiple="multiple" size="3"&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="1"&gt;Option 1&lt;/option&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="2"&gt;Option 2&lt;/option&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="3"&gt;Option 3&lt;/option&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="4"&gt;Option 4&lt;/option&gt;<br />
&lt;option value="5"&gt;Option 5&lt;/option&gt;<br />
&lt;/select&gt;</span><br />
which equates to this:<br />

<option value="2">Option 2</option>
<option value="3">Option 3</option>
<option value="4">Option 4</option>
<option value="5">Option 5</option>
</select><br /><br />

<b>Multiple selection Checkboxes (checkbox)</b>: In HTML, this is<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;input type="checkbox" name="name" value="1" /&gt; Option 1<br />
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="name" value="2" /&gt; Option 2</span><br />

Users ranks are rank insignia based on post count and usergroup that are displayed next to names in posts.  User ranks work very similar to user titles, the main difference being that user titles are for all usergroups while user ranks can be created for specific usergroups.  In this way you can create different rank insignia for different usergroups.  User ranks appear next to names in posts.]]></text>

<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=replacement&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Replacement Variables</a><br /><br />

<b>Replacement Variables:</b><br />
Replacement variables are raw string replacements for your templates that are case-<b>in</b>sensitive.<br /><br />

For example, if you create a replacement variable using the variable string "vbulletin" and the replacement string "is cool", then these template strings will be parsed into the following strings upon loading a forum page:<br /><br />

Template string: <i>Powered by vBulletin</i><br />
Parsed string: <i>Powered by is cool</i><br /><br />

Template string: <i>vBULLetin3</i><br />
Parsed string: <i>is cool3</i><br /><br />

You can use replacement variables the same way vBulletin uses stylevars (see "Common Templates, StyleVars, and CSS" link above).  If you use the same string in several templates then you can create a replacement variable for it.  You can use the replacement variable in the templates and set its value in this Replacement Variable Manager.  If you need to change the value of the string then you can edit the replacement variable which will change its value in every template where the variable occurs.]]></text>

You can run reports for a specific stat over a specific time period to view patterns of activity on your forums.  Patterns of forum activity can be used for many different things.

			<title date="1161596934" username="Jelsoft" version="3.6.3"><![CDATA[About Styles &amp; Templates]]></title>
			<text date="1205942760" username="Jelsoft" version="3.7.0 Release Candidate 1"><![CDATA[<b>Related General Help Topics:</b><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=template&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Styles &amp; Templates</a><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=css&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Common Templates, StyleVars, and CSS</a><br />
<a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=replacement&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">Replacement Variables</a><br /><br />

<b>Inheritance:</b><br />
vBulletin's styles use inheritance to manage templates and style settings.  A child style inherits the templates and settings of its parent.  For example, if a template is customized in a parent style then its children will inherit that customized template as their default.<br /><br />

Possible applications of style inheritance include creating variations on a theme.  Let's say you have a style with a customized template set that creates a specific physical layout of your forums, but you want your users to be able to choose from different colors while using the same layout.  In that situation you could create child styles for the style with the customized template set.  The children would inherit all of the parent's templates, thereby keeping the same layout, but they would have their own color settings which would override the colors of the parent.<br /><br />

The power of inheritance can be seen in the above example.  To create variations on a theme without inheritance you would need to duplicate the template set for each style which would make changing the layout very cumbersome as you would need to edit the templates in each style.  With inheritance you only have to edit the parent's template set.<br /><br />

<b>Template Conditionals:</b><br />
vBulletin supports conditionals in its templates.  Conditionals allow you to display code in the templates or not based on a condition that evaluates to boolean true or false.  Here is an example of the syntax:<br /><br />

<i>&lt;if condition="$bbuserinfo[userid]"&gt;<br />
<font color="green">code that is displayed if the user is registered and logged in (not a guest)</font><br />
&lt;else /&gt;<br />
<font color="red">code that is displayed if the user is not registered and/or not logged in (is a guest)</font><br />
&lt;/if&gt;</i><br /><br />

In the above example, the condition checks for whether or not the logged in user is registered by checking their userid (guests have a userid of 0 which evaluates to false).  The <font color="green">green</font> code is included in the page output if the user is logged in (the condition is true).  Else the <font color="red">red</font> code is included if the user is <b>not</b> logged in (the condition is false).  The <i>&lt;else /&gt;</i> tag and <font color="red">red</font> code are optional in the syntax shown above.<br /><br />

The $bbuserinfo array in the above example contains all of the current logged in user's information and is global to all vBulletin templates.  The $vboptions array is another such global array that holds the values for your <a href="options.php?null=0" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>.]]></text>

This section of the Admin CP allows you to mass manage threads and posts.  You can mass prune and mass move threads and posts based on several criteria, mass unsubscribe users from threads, strip polls from threads, and see who voted for poll options in polls.<br /><br />

Possible applications for mass pruning threads include removing a spammer's threads and freeing up space in your database by deleting old threads.  Applications for mass moving threads include reorganizing your forums and archiving old threads in an archive forum.  You can unsubscribe users from threads to stop email notifications as a result of current thread subscriptions.  You can strip a poll from a thread if you want to delete a poll but not the thread that contains it.  Lastly, the "Who Voted" feature is useful in checking for "stuffed vote boxes."]]></text>

vBulletin's user system is made up of several different parts so make sure you read the related help topics above.  Within the "Users" tab of the Admin CP you have the ability to add new users, search for existing users based on several criteria, prune users, and do several other things that are covered in the "User Tools," "User Banning," "Emailing Users," and "Access Masks" help topics that are linked above.<br /><br />

Adding a new user via the Admin CP is the same as some one registering a new account except that the "add form" in the Admin CP is free of the required fields and agreements that are imposed on the registration form.  For example, you can create an account without an email address when using the Admin CP.  Visit the <a href="user.php?do=add" target="_blank">Add New User</a> page to add a user via the Admin CP.<br /><br />

vBulletin's user search system provides you with numerous search criteria and display options.  You can use the user search feature to find and edit users and to run reports showing specific user info and profile fields.  See the <a href="user.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Search for Users</a> page to see the list of search and display options.<br /><br />

vBulletin's user system also allows you to prune / move users based on their usergroup, last visit date, join date, and post count.  Possible applications of the user pruning / moving system include cleaning out inactive users and changing usergroups to manage forum permissions.  The user pruning / moving page can be found <a href="user.php?do=prune" target="_blank">here</a>.]]></text>

<b>Usergroups:</b><br />
vBulletin's usergroup system, like any usergroup system, is used for managing forum permissions.  You can manage forum permissions by putting users into groups and setting permissions for the groups.  In addition, vBulletin takes usergroups to a new level by allowing users to belong to multiple groups and to submit join requests for groups.  On top of this, vBulletin lets you setup group promotions to automatically change a user's group memberships when certain conditions are met.<br /><br />

Usergroup permissions have two levels to them, the first of which is the usergroup permissions that are set in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.  By default, a user will have these permissions everywhere on your forums.  If you want to set exceptions to default usergroup permissions then you can do so by editing usergroup permissions at the forum-level on the <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a> page.  On the Forum Permissions page you can set group permissions on a per-forum basis.  The <a href="calendarpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Calendar Permissions</a> page provides similar functionality for calendars.  Other usergroup permissions can only be set at the highest usergroup-level in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.<br /><br />

vBulletin also allows users to belong to multiple usergroups.  There are two kinds of usergroups, primary and secondary (also called member groups).  A user can belong to only one primary group but can belong to any number of secondary groups.  A user's primary group is used to define their base forum permissions; at a minimum, a user will always have their primary group's forum permissions.  Secondary groups, on the other hand, can be used to grant additional permissions that are not granted by a user's primary group.<br /><br />

For secondary groups to be able to affect a user's permissions, the user's primary group needs to have the "Allow Users to have Member Groups" option enabled in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.  The way the overlapping of primary and secondary permissions works is that the user is always given the "greater" of the multiple settings for the same permission.  For example, if a user's primary group has "Can View Forum" set to No and one of the same user's secondary groups has "Can View Forum" set to Yes, then the user's final setting for that permission will be Yes.  Numeric group permissions overlap in a similar way, except instead of Yes or No the user is given the more lenient of the two numbers.  Possible applications of secondary groups for forum permissions include granting access to a private forum where multiple primary groups can have access.  The primary groups in question would have null access to the private forum set on the <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a> page.  The secondary group would have all permissions set to No in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a> but would have forum-level access to the private forum set on the <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a> page.  The result of adding a user to this secondary group would be that its "Yes" permissions for the private forum would override the null access of their primary group.  This is much more convenient than setting up redundant permissions for additional primary groups that have access to the private forum, which is what would need to be done without secondary groups.<br /><br />

If the user's primary group does not have the "Allow Users to have Member Groups" option enabled in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a> then secondary group memberships will have no effect on their permissions.  Secondary groups serve no purpose in this case.  The only reason this option should be disabled in a primary group is if the group is a banned group, in which case you don't want secondary group memberships to override the null access of the banned group.<br /><br />

Another feature of vBulletin's usergroup system is the ability for users to request memberships into groups.  In this way vBulletin allows users to request forum permissions because forum permissions are controlled with group memberships.  Users can request to join a group on the <a href="../profile.php?do=editusergroups" target="_blank">Group Memberships</a> page in their User CP.  Users can only request to join custom groups that have the "Public (Joinable) Custom Usergroups" option enabled in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.  You can manage join requests on the <a href="usergroup.php?do=viewjoinrequests" target="_blank">Join Requests</a> page.  Optionally, you can appoint group leaders in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a> that can manage join requests for their group on the <a href="../profile.php?do=editusergroups" target="_blank">Group Memberships</a> page in their User CP.<br /><br />

vBulletin's usergroup system also supports group promotions based on certain conditions.  Promotions are used to change a user's group memberships when they reach a certain reputation level, number of days registered, and / or post count.  Promotions used in conjunction with user reputations can be especially powerful (see the general help topic for <a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=adminreputation&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">User Reputations</a>).  You can manage your promotions on the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modifypromotion" target="_blank">Promotions</a> page.]]></text>

<b>User Tools:</b><br />
The user tools pages in the Users tab of the Admin CP provide you with the ability to merge users, view and manage private messages, view referral information, and search user IP addresses.<br /><br />

The ability to merge users can be very useful when dealing with users who have multiple accounts.  The "Merge Users" feature literally signs over all of a user's posts, private messages, etc to another user account.  You can see the "Merge Users" page <a href="usertools.php?do=merge" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />

You can view your forum's private message statistics <a href="usertools.php?do=pmstats" target="_blank">here</a>.  This section allows you to view private message statistics for your users according to how many private messages they have stored.  You are also given the option to delete a user's private messages from this section of the Admin CP.<br /><br />

If you have referrals enabled in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=register&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a> then users will be able to link to your forums using their referral id to get credit for referring users to your forums.  You can run a report showing referrals on your forums on the <a href="usertools.php?do=referrers" target="_blank">Referrals</a> page.  This is useful in seeing which users are referring people to your forums.<br /><br />

Lastly, you can search for users based on IP address or search for IP addresses based on a username on the <a href="usertools.php?do=doips" target="_blank">Search IP Addresses</a> page.  vBulletin logs the IP addresses of users who visit your forum.  Everyone on the internet has an IP address.  Some internet services assign a new IP address every time a user connects, while some assign just one IP address.  Users with dynamic IPs can be more elusive than those with static IPs, but either way, IP addresses can be used to identify and target users.  Possible applications for searching for IP addresses include identifying other accounts of a person who has a specific IP address and <a href="options.php?dogroup=banning&amp;do=options" target="_blank">IP banning</a> problem users.]]></text>
